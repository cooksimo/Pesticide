Pesticide
================

Pesticide is a  debugging framework for iOS which allows developers to use build in and custom debug controls at runtime. Pesticide was inspired by the [Debug Drawer](https://github.com/JakeWharton/u2020) for Android.

## Features
- [x] In app debug menu
- [x] App level HTTP proxy configuration
- [x] Logger console
- [x] Adding custom commands to trigger closure execution
- [x] Crosshair alignment tool
- [x] View all touches tool
- [x] View hierarchy analysis tool
- [x] Adding custom controls to debug menu
- [x] Current Build and Device information

## Requirements

- iOS 7.0+ / Mac OS X 10.9+
- Xcode 6.1

## Communication

Importing target with Git submodule

- If you **found a bug**, open an issue.
- If you **have a feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a pull request.

## Installation

_Due to the current lack of [proper infrastructure](http://cocoapods.org) for Swift dependeny management, using Pesticide in your project requires the following steps:_

1. Add pesticide as a [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by opening the Terminal, `cd`-ing into your top-level project directory, and entering the command `git submodule add https://github.com/eliasbagley/Pesticide.git`
2. Open the `debug-drawer` folder, and drag `debugdrawer.xcodeproj` into the file navigator of your app project.
3. In Xcode, navigate to the target configuration window by clicking on the blue project icon, and selecting the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
4. Ensure that the deployment target of debugdrawer.xcodeproj matches that of the application target.
5. In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "Build Phases" panel.
6. Expand the "Target Dependencies" group, and add debug-drawer

## Usage

### Setup Pesticide

In your app delegate, simply call
```swift
Pesticide.setWindow(myWindow)
```
to setup Pesticide

### Using Pesticide

You can log to the pesticide live console using
```swift
Pesticide.log("Hello, World!")
```

You can add custom controls to the debug view controller using any of:

```swift
Pesticide.addSwitch(intialValue: Bool, name: String, block: Bool -> ())
Pesticide.addButton(name: String, block: () -> ())
Pesticide.addSlider(initialValue: Float, name: String, block: Float -> ())
Pesticide.addDropdown(initialValue: String, name: String, options: Dictionary<String,AnyObject>, block: (option: AnyObject) -> ())
Pesticide.addLabel(name: String, label: String)
Pesticide.addTextInput(name: String, block: (String) -> ())
```

The blocks are callbacks used when the value of the control is changed, allowing you to add custom functionality and run arbitrary code


Pesticde has a control to configure app level proxy settings, rather than having to set the proxy at the system level

```swift
Pesticide.addProxy(block: (NSURLSessionConfiguration?) -> ())
```
addProxy accepts a closure that passes in NSURLSessionConfiguration? object allowing you to plug into whatever networking framework your project uses.
the NSURLSessionConfiguration will be configured based on a host and port. The syntax for the proxy textfield is "host:port"
e.g.
111.11.11.1:8888

You can also add more customized functionality using
```swift
Pesticide.addCommand(commandName: String, block: Array<String> -> ())
```
The block takes an array of words used in the command following the commandName. e.g.
```swift
Pesticide.addCommand("stab", block: { (components: Array<String>) in
                if components.count < 1 {
                    return;
                }
                if let times = components[0].toInt() {
                    for count in 0..<times {
                        Pesticide.log("die, die, die")
                    }
                }
            })
```
then, in the textfield, you can run:
```
stab 2
```
to get the output:

die, die, die
die, die, die

in the live view of the pesticide log

## Builtin Controls

Pesticide comes configured with several debugging tools.

The hierarchy viewer allows you to tap on views to remove them from the view hierarchy, thus peeling away at the views to reveal what is underneath

The crosshair view displays a crosshair overlay, useful for designers to check if UI components are correctly lined up and using the correct margins

The show touches tool shows a small blip at the touch location
